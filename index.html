              "I remember you was conflicted Misusing your influence Sometimes I
              did the same Abusing my power, full of resentment Resentment that
              turned into a deep depression Found myself screaming in the hotel
              room I didn't wanna self-destruct The evils of Lucy was all around
              me So I went running for answers Until I came home But that didn't
              stop survivor's guilt Going back and forth trying to convince
              myself the stripes I earned Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was But
              while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the
              city I was entering a new one A war that was based on apartheid
              and discrimination Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the
              homies what I learned The word was respect Just because you wore a
              different gang color than mine's Doesn't mean I can't respect you
              as a black man Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each
              other in these streets If I respect you, we unify and stop the
              enemy from killing us But I don't know, I'm no mortal man Maybe
              I'm just another nigga"
