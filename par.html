            Bitch, fuck<br />
            Uh, uh<br />
            Fuck<br />
            You have a question?<br />
            How many cars can I buy 'til I run outta drive?<br />
            How much drive can I have until I run outta road?<br />
            How much road can they pave until I run outta land?<br />
            How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?<br />
            Niggas go with the motions and all the plans<br />
            See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands<br />
            See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies<br />
            Falling outta my pocket, but y'all want to know if I swam to cool
            down<br />
            How much cooler can I get until run out of fans?<br />
            How many fans can I have until they turn on the A/C?<br />
            If the A/C blow up, well then, I'm TNT, I'm gone<br />
            I'm gone and I'm finished<br />
            And I ain't seen my friends in a minute<br />
            I'm guessing nothing lasts forever<br />
            No, nothing lasts forever<br />
            Nothing sticks together<br />
            I'm sick of sitting in doubt<br />
            Please let me figure this out<br />
            Shout out to the girls that I led on<br />
            For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm<br />
            And tryin' they hardest to keep my head on straight<br />
            And keeping me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne<br />
            How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?<br />
            How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?<br />
            How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arrives?<br />
            How many riots can it be until them black lives matter?<br />
            When niggas click, clack, splatter, pew, pew that nigga<br />
            Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga<br />
            'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull<br />
            'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool<br />
            'Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full<br />
            And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one (nah)<br />
            Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms<br />
            And rooms got some windows and my windows got some views<br />
            And views get some stairs and my backyard does too<br />
            And if you walk to the bottom, you'll probably see a pool<br />
            You better not drown, keep them ten toes up<br />
            'Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up<br />
            And that's what I swim in<br />
            And if I drown and don't come back<br />
            Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)<br />
            And if I crash and don't come back<br />
            Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)<br />
            And if I fall and don't come back<br />
            Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)<br />
            I'm wondering if I don't come back<br />
            Maybe then I'll know<br />
            Don't come back<br />
            Don't come back<br />
            Ayy, don't come back<br />
            Don't come back, no, no<br />
